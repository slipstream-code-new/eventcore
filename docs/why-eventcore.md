## What Makes EventCore Different?

### Traditional Event Sourcing Problems

**Rigid Aggregate Boundaries**:
```rust
// Traditional: Forced into artificial boundaries
struct Account {
    id: AccountId,
    balance: Money,
    // Can't atomically access other accounts for transfers
}

// Transfer requires distributed transaction or saga
async fn transfer_money(from: AccountId, to: AccountId, amount: Money) {
    // 😞 This breaks atomicity:
    // 1. Withdraw from source
    // 2. Deposit to target (might fail!)
    // 3. Handle partial failure with compensating actions
}
```

**EventCore Solution**:
```rust
// EventCore: Dynamic boundaries per operation
#[derive(Command)]
struct TransferMoney {
    from: AccountId,
    to: AccountId,
    amount: Money,
}

impl Command for TransferMoney {
    fn read_streams(&self, input: &Self::Input) -> Vec<StreamId> {
        // Define consistency boundary for THIS operation
        vec![input.from.stream_id(), input.to.stream_id()]
    }
    
    async fn handle(&self, streams: ReadStreams, ...) -> CommandResult<...> {
        // ✅ Atomic across both accounts
        // ✅ No distributed transaction needed
        // ✅ No saga complexity
        Ok(vec![
            StreamWrite::new(&streams, input.from.stream_id(), MoneyWithdrawn { amount }),
            StreamWrite::new(&streams, input.to.stream_id(), MoneyDeposited { amount }),
        ])
    }
}
```

### Key Advantages

1. **Dynamic Consistency Boundaries**: Each command defines its own consistency scope
2. **No Distributed Transactions**: Multi-entity operations are atomic at the database level
3. **Type Safety**: Compiler prevents writing to undeclared streams
4. **Zero Boilerplate**: No aggregate classes or entity management
5. **Stream Discovery**: Commands can discover additional streams during execution

## When to Choose EventCore

### ✅ Perfect Fit: Complex Business Domains

**Financial Systems**:
- Cross-account transfers
- Multi-party transactions
- Regulatory compliance with audit trails

**E-commerce Platforms**:
- Order processing across inventory, payments, and shipping
- Inventory reservations across multiple warehouses
- Customer credit and loyalty point management

**Workflow Management**:
- Approval processes spanning multiple entities
- Resource allocation across departments
- Multi-step business processes

**Real Estate/Property Management**:
- Property transactions involving multiple parties
- Rental agreements with property, tenant, and payment streams
- Maintenance workflows across properties and vendors

### ✅ Good Fit: Growing Complexity

**Scenarios**:
- You started with simple CRUD but need cross-entity operations
- Distributed transactions are becoming a pain point
- You need strong audit trails with business logic validation
- Your domain has natural event-driven workflows

**Migration Path**:
```rust
// Phase 1: Start with simple operations
struct CreateAccount { ... }  // Single stream

// Phase 2: Add cross-entity operations naturally
struct TransferBetweenAccounts { ... }  // Multi-stream

// Phase 3: Complex workflows
struct ProcessLoanApplication { ... }  // Dynamic discovery
```

### ❌ Poor Fit: Simple Applications

**When NOT to use EventCore**:

1. **Basic CRUD Applications**:
   ```rust
   // If this is your complexity level, use a traditional database
   struct User {
       name: String,
       email: String,
   }
   
   // EventCore is overkill for simple create/update/delete
   ```

2. **Single-Entity Operations Only**:
   ```rust
   // Use a traditional event sourcing library instead
   struct ShoppingCart {
       items: Vec<Item>,
       // No cross-entity operations needed
   }
   ```

3. **Read-Heavy Applications**:
   ```rust
   // Consider CQRS with projections instead
   // EventCore excels at complex writes, not optimized reads
   ```

4. **Team Learning Event Sourcing**:
   - Start with EventStore or similar
   - Learn event sourcing concepts first
   - Migrate to EventCore once comfortable

## Performance Characteristics

### What to Expect

**Realistic Throughput** (PostgreSQL backend):
- Single-stream commands: ~90 ops/sec
- Multi-stream commands: Currently limited by a known bug
- Batch operations: ~2,000 events/sec

**Latency Profile**:
- P95 latency: 14-20ms (slightly above 10ms target)
- Good for business applications
- Not suitable for high-frequency trading

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Correctness over speed**: Multi-stream atomicity comes first
- ✅ **Simplicity over performance**: Eliminates distributed transaction complexity
- ❌ **Lower throughput**: Than specialized solutions
- ❌ **Higher latency**: Than in-memory systems

### Performance Comparison

| Solution | Single Ops/sec | Multi-Entity | Consistency | Complexity |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **EventCore** | 90 | ✅ Atomic | Strong | Low |
| **Traditional ES** | 1,000+ | ❌ Manual | Eventual | Medium |
| **RDBMS** | 10,000+ | ✅ ACID | Strong | High |
| **Event Store** | 500+ | ❌ Sagas | Eventual | High |

## Common Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "We need better audit trails"

**Current**: Traditional database with audit table
**Problem**: Audit data disconnected from business logic
**Solution**: 
- Simple audit needs → Add audit table
- Complex business rules → EventCore

### Scenario 2: "Our distributed transactions are failing"

**Current**: Microservices with REST calls
**Problem**: Partial failures, compensation logic complexity
**Solution**: 
- ✅ **EventCore** - Turn distributed transactions into atomic commands

### Scenario 3: "We need to scale read performance"

**Current**: Event sourcing with slow projections
**Problem**: Read-heavy workload
**Solution**: 
- ❌ **Not EventCore** - Use CQRS with optimized read models

### Scenario 4: "We want to adopt event sourcing"

**Current**: Traditional RDBMS application
**Problem**: Team new to event sourcing
**Solution**: 
- Start with EventStore or Axon Framework
- Learn event sourcing patterns
- Migrate to EventCore for multi-stream needs

## Migration Strategies

### From Traditional Database

1. **Start Small**: Convert one bounded context
2. **Event-First**: Model events for that context
3. **Command Layer**: Add EventCore commands gradually
4. **Dual Write**: Maintain both systems during transition
5. **Full Migration**: Switch to EventCore as primary

### From Traditional Event Sourcing

1. **Identify Multi-Stream Operations**: Find distributed transactions
2. **Convert Commands**: Migrate to EventCore command pattern
3. **Stream Mapping**: Map aggregates to streams
4. **Business Logic**: Move from aggregates to commands
5. **Remove Sagas**: Replace with atomic commands

## Decision Checklist

Before choosing EventCore, ask:

- [ ] Do I need cross-entity transactions?
- [ ] Is my domain complex enough to justify event sourcing?
- [ ] Can my team handle event sourcing concepts?
- [ ] Are my performance requirements realistic? (< 1,000 ops/sec)
- [ ] Do I value correctness over raw performance?
- [ ] Am I willing to trade throughput for simplicity?
- [ ] Does my domain have natural event-driven workflows?

**If you answered "yes" to most questions, EventCore is likely a good fit.**

## Getting Started

If EventCore seems right for your use case:

1. **Read the [First Command Tutorial](docs/tutorials/first-command.md)**
2. **Try the [Banking Example](eventcore-examples/src/banking/)**
3. **Start with single-stream commands**
4. **Gradually add multi-stream operations**
5. **Join the community** for support and feedback

## Conclusion

EventCore excels at **complex business domains** where **cross-entity operations** are common and **correctness is more important than raw performance**. It's not suitable for simple CRUD applications or high-throughput systems.

The key insight: if you find yourself building distributed transactions, sagas, or complex compensation logic, EventCore can eliminate most of that complexity with atomic multi-stream commands.

Choose EventCore when your domain complexity justifies the event sourcing approach, and you need the atomic multi-entity operations that traditional event sourcing can't provide.
