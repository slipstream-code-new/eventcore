/// Trait defining the contract for event store implementations.
///
/// Event stores provide two core operations:
/// 1. Read events from streams for state reconstruction
/// 2. Atomically append events to streams with version checking
///
/// The EventStore trait hides implementation details of how backends achieve
/// atomicity (PostgreSQL uses ACID transactions, in-memory uses locks, etc.).
/// Library consumers interact with simple read/append operations.
///
/// Implementations include:
/// - `eventcore-postgres`: Production PostgreSQL backend with ACID guarantees
/// - `eventcore-memory`: In-memory backend for testing
///
/// # Immutability Guarantee
///
/// Event stores are append-only. Once an event is written, it must never be
/// modified or deleted. This is a fundamental invariant of event sourcing:
/// events represent facts that have already occurred in the business domain.
///
/// Implementations MUST ensure this immutability through whatever mechanisms
/// their storage backend provides:
/// - SQL databases: Use triggers/rules to reject UPDATE/DELETE operations
/// - Purpose-built event stores (e.g., Kurrent/EventStoreDB): Rely on native
///   append-only semantics
/// - In-memory stores: May omit enforcement (test-only, ephemeral)
///
/// The `eventcore-postgres` backend enforces immutability via database triggers
/// that raise errors on any attempt to UPDATE or DELETE event records.
