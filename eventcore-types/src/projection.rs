//! Projection types and traits for building read models from event streams.
//!
//! This module provides the core abstractions for event projection:
//! - `Projector`: Trait for transforming events into read model updates
//! - `EventReader`: Trait for reading events globally for projections
//! - `StreamPosition`: Global position in the event stream

/// Context provided to error handler when event processing fails.
///
/// This struct bundles together all the information needed to make
/// informed decisions about how to handle a projection failure.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `E`: The error type returned by the projector's `apply()` method
///
/// # Fields
///
/// - `error`: Reference to the error that occurred
/// - `position`: Global stream position where the failure occurred
/// - `retry_count`: Number of times this event has been retried (0 on first failure)
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct FailureContext<'a, E> {
    /// Reference to the error that occurred during event processing.
    pub error: &'a E,
    /// Global stream position of the event that failed to process.
    pub position: StreamPosition,
    /// Number of retry attempts so far (0 on initial failure).
    pub retry_count: u32,
}

/// Strategy for handling event processing failures.
///
/// When a projector's `apply()` method returns an error, the `on_error()`
/// callback determines how the projection runner should respond. This enum
/// represents the available failure strategies.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Fatal`: Stop processing immediately and return the error
/// - `Skip`: Log the error and continue processing the next event
/// - `Retry`: Attempt to reprocess the event according to retry configuration
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn on_error(
///     &mut self,
///     ctx: FailureContext<Self::Error>,
/// ) -> FailureStrategy {
///     match ctx.error {
///         MyError::Transient(_) if ctx.retry_count < 3 => FailureStrategy::Retry,
///         MyError::PoisonEvent(_) => FailureStrategy::Skip,
///         _ => FailureStrategy::Fatal,
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// Stop processing immediately and return the error to the caller.
    ///
    /// Use this when:
    /// - The error is unrecoverable (e.g., database schema mismatch)
    /// - The projector requires manual intervention
    /// - Continuing would corrupt the read model
    Fatal,

    /// Skip this event and continue processing the next one.
    ///
    /// Use this when:
    /// - The event is malformed or invalid (poison event)
    /// - Processing this event is not critical
    /// - Continuing without this event is acceptable
    Skip,

    /// Retry processing this event according to retry configuration.
    ///
    /// Use this when:
    /// - The error is likely transient (e.g., network timeout)
    /// - Retrying might succeed
    /// - The event is important and should not be skipped
    Retry,
}

/// Global stream position representing a location in the ordered event log.
///
/// StreamPosition uniquely identifies a position in the global event stream
/// across all individual streams. Used by projectors to track progress and
/// enable resumable event processing.
///
/// Positions are 0-indexed: position 0 is the first event ever appended.

/// Trait for transforming events into read model updates.
///
/// Projectors consume events from the event store and update read models.
/// They implement the "Q" (Query) side of CQRS by building denormalized
/// views optimized for reading.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `Event`: The domain event type this projector handles
/// - `Error`: The error type returned when projection fails
/// - `Context`: Shared context for database connections, caches, etc.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// - `apply`: Process a single event and update the read model
/// - `name`: Return a unique identifier for this projector
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// struct AccountBalanceProjector {
///     balances: HashMap<AccountId, Money>,
/// }
///
/// impl Projector for AccountBalanceProjector {
///     type Event = AccountEvent;
///     type Error = Infallible;
///     type Context = ();
///
///     fn apply(
///         &mut self,
///         event: Self::Event,
///         _position: StreamPosition,

///                 *self.balances.entry(account_id).or_default() += amount;
