# Architecture Decisions

**Value:** Communication -- architecture decisions recorded before
implementation ensure every contributor (human or agent) understands why
the system is shaped the way it is. Decisions made in silence are decisions
lost.

## Purpose

Teaches the agent to record architecture decisions before implementing them,
maintain a living architecture document, and facilitate structured decision-making.
Prevents the common failure mode where architecture emerges accidentally and
rationale is lost.

## Practices

### Record Decisions Before Implementation

Never implement a structural change without first recording the decision. An
architecture decision is any choice that affects system structure, technology
stack, domain boundaries, integration patterns, or cross-cutting concerns.

1. Identify the decision: what problem motivates this choice?
2. Document alternatives: at least two realistic options with tradeoffs
3. Record the chosen approach and its consequences
4. Only then proceed to implementation

**Do:**

- Record decisions when they are made, while context is fresh
- One decision per record -- keep them atomic
- State decisions in active voice: "We will use PostgreSQL for event storage"
- Acknowledge negative consequences honestly

**Do not:**

- Document decisions after implementation as retroactive justification
- Bundle multiple decisions into one record
- Omit alternatives -- a decision without alternatives is not a decision

### Maintain the Living Architecture Document

`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the single authoritative source for current system
architecture. It describes WHAT the architecture IS, not WHY it became that way
(the WHY lives in decision records).

Structure:

```markdown
# Architecture

## Overview

High-level system description

## Key Decisions

Current architectural choices (link to decision records)

## Components

Major system components and their responsibilities

## Patterns

Patterns in use (event sourcing, CQRS, etc.)

## Constraints

Current constraints and known tradeoffs
```

Update this document whenever a decision changes the architecture. Keep it
current -- a stale architecture document is worse than none.

### Use ADR-as-PR Format

When the project uses GitHub, architecture decision records live as PR
descriptions, not standalone files. This gives decisions a natural lifecycle:

- **Open PR** = proposed decision, under review
- **Merged PR** = accepted decision
- **Closed PR** = rejected decision
- **New PR with "Supersedes #N"** = revised decision

Each ADR PR:

1. Branches independently from main (`adr/<slug>`)
2. Updates `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with the current decision
3. You MUST use `references/adr-template.md` for the PR description as the full decision record
4. Gets labeled `adr` for discoverability

When GitHub PRs are not available, record the architecture decision in
the commit message of the commit that updates `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Use the same template structure (Context, Decision, Alternatives,
Consequences). The commit message becomes the decision record, and
`git log -- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` becomes the decision history.

### Facilitate Decisions Systematically

When multiple architectural decisions are needed (new project, major redesign):

1. **Inventory decision points** across categories: technology stack, domain
   boundaries, integration patterns, cross-cutting concerns
2. **Present the agenda** to the human for review before facilitating
3. **For each decision**: present context, present 2-4 options with tradeoffs,
   let the human choose, record immediately
4. **Never batch** -- record each decision individually so they can be reviewed
   and accepted independently

### Review for Architectural Alignment

Before approving implementation work, verify it aligns with documented
architecture:

- Does it follow patterns documented in ARCHITECTURE.md?
- Does it respect domain boundaries?
- Does it introduce new dependencies or patterns not yet decided?
- If it conflicts, record a new decision before proceeding

## Enforcement Note

This skill provides advisory guidance. It instructs the agent to record
decisions before implementation but cannot mechanically prevent implementation
without a decision record. The agent follows these practices by convention.
If you observe implementation proceeding without a decision record, point it
out.

## Verification

After completing work guided by this skill, verify:

- [ ] Every structural change has a corresponding decision record
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` reflects the current architecture
- [ ] Each decision record states context, alternatives, and consequences
- [ ] No decision was recorded retroactively after implementation
- [ ] Decision records are atomic (one decision per record)

If any criterion is not met, record the missing decision before proceeding.

## Dependencies

This skill works standalone. For enhanced workflows, it integrates with:

- **event-modeling:** Completed event models surface the decision points that
  need architectural choices (technology, boundaries, integration patterns)
- **domain-modeling:** Domain model constraints inform bounded context
  boundaries and aggregate design decisions
- **code-review:** Reviewers verify implementation aligns with documented
  architecture decisions
